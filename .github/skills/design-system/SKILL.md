  Apply clean, light, modern UI design to any application. Use this skill whenever the user
  asks to design, style, theme, beautify, improve, or fix the UI/UX of any application —
  web, mobile, desktop, or notifications. Also use when creating new components, pages, 
  layouts, or making any visual design decisions. Even if the user doesn't say "design" — 
  if they're building UI, styling elements, picking colors, choosing fonts, laying out pages,
  creating forms, buttons, cards, or anything user-facing, this skill applies. This skill 
  gives you SPECIFIC instructions on exactly what CSS/style changes to make, not just 
  general principles. Follow the step-by-step process below.

# Design System — Ive Principles

This skill tells you exactly how to make any UI embody the **design principles** 
of Sir Jony Ive. Ive shaped Apple's design language for 27 years and continues 
refining these ideas through LoveFrom (Ferrari Luce, Airbnb, OpenAI). We draw 
from *both* his Apple legacy and his post-Apple work — using the best of each, 
not copying either 1:1.

**The balance**: Apple's HIG, Liquid Glass, and iOS remain world-class references 
for UI patterns, color systems, and interaction design — Ive created much of that 
foundation. But we also learn from his Ferrari Luce interior (2026) where he went 
beyond screens: physical controls, material honesty, avionics precision. The 
combination of both worlds — digital interface mastery AND physical product 
discipline — is what makes this system distinctive.

## Design Principles

Roots: **Dieter Rams** ("as little design as possible"), **Bauhaus** ("form 
follows function"), **Apple HIG** (clarity, deference, depth), and Ive's own 
**material honesty** discipline refined across 30+ years.

### Core Principles

1. **Function over garnish** — "Everything is founded on being functional. It's 
   not styled, it's not garnish, because that's a distraction and it doesn't last 
   well." (Ive, Ferrari Luce 2026). Every element justifies its existence.

2. **Each element is a product** — "We treated every single element as if it was 
   a camera or a watch." A button, an input, a card — each deserves obsessive 
   care. No element is too small to design well.

3. **Singular coherence** — "It felt like designing hundreds of products, but in 
   aggregate it feels singular and coherent." One radius, one weight system, one 
   spacing grid, one accent color. Unity through consistency.

4. **Material honesty** — Surfaces communicate their role through subtle light, 
   shadow, and weight. No fake effects. Depth comes from luminosity shifts — 
   Apple's Liquid Glass principle: translucent layers that let content show through.

5. **Reduction to essence** — Apple HIG calls this "deference": the UI recedes so 
   content comes forward. Remove what doesn't serve. But make what remains excellent.

6. **Tactile engagement** — Ive chose physical toggles over touchscreens for 
   Ferrari because "the functionality is superior." In UI: hover states, active 
   states, and transitions should feel like well-machined controls responding to 
   touch. Interactive elements NEED visual feedback.

7. **Reducing cognitive load** — Dashboard metrics read at a glance. Navigation is 
   instantly parseable. The hierarchy guides the eye effortlessly.

8. **Timelessness over trend** — Design for years, not months. Avoid trendy effects. 
   Use established patterns (Apple HIG, Material Design) that will look right in 5 years.

9. **Obsessive precision** — Mathematically consistent spacing (4px/8px grid), 
   optically balanced alignment, no arbitrary values. Like Apple's SF Pro optical 
   sizes — different weights are tuned for different scales.

## What "Good" Looks Like

The target aesthetic is **precise, confident, and warm**. The interface feels 
crafted and human — like an Apple product: you pick it up and it just *works*, 
everything is in the right place, nothing is superfluous.

**Reference products (study all of these):**
- **Apple HIG / Liquid Glass** — Translucent layers, depth through refraction, 
  controls that float above content. The gold standard for mobile/web UI patterns.
- **iOS Settings app** — Grouped lists, clear hierarchy, zero decoration. Study how 
  sections, labels, and toggles work together.
- **Apple.com product pages** — Vast whitespace, surgical typography, images that breathe.
- **Ferrari Luce interior** (LoveFrom, 2026) — Physical controls, CNC aluminum, 
  avionics precision. Each element treated as a standalone product.
- **Linear** (linear.app) — Disciplined SaaS UI: one accent, precise spacing, quiet.
- **Stripe Dashboard** — Dense data with extreme clarity and hierarchy.
- **Vercel** — Monochrome restraint with surgical accent use.
- **SF Symbols** — Apple's icon system: optically balanced, consistent weight across 
  thousands of glyphs. The reference for icon consistency.

**Key insights from testing (learned through iterations):**
- **Toggle/segmented controls**: Apple-style white selected tab on gray bg with tiny 
  shadow — like a physical switch. Function, not style.
- **Navigation**: Active items use subtle bg fill (`--bg-subtle`) + weight 500 + 
  near-black text. This provides tactile feedback — the user knows where they are.
- **Card shadows**: `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.04)` — subtle elevation. Most cards use 
  1px border. Shadow only for elements that genuinely float.
- **Form labels**: Small uppercase scaffolding (11px, weight 500, #A0A0A0). Like 
  laser-etched markings — guide without demanding attention.
- **Metric numbers**: Weight 300 (light). Like the physical aluminum needle on the 
  Ferrari Luce instruments — present, readable, refined. Not ultralight (200, too 
  fragile) and not semibold (600, too heavy).
- **Text rendering**: `text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; -webkit-font-smoothing: 
  antialiased;` — precision in every pixel.
- **Always deploy with API**: When deploying to SWA or similar, include the API 
  backend (`--api-location api`). Frontend-only deploys can overwrite the API.
- **Toast notifications, never alert()**: Use a toast/notification system for all 
  error messages — never `window.alert()` or `window.confirm()`. Place toasts at 
  top-right on desktop, bottom-center on mobile. Auto-dismiss after 4s. Use inline
  confirmation dialogs for destructive actions, not `window.confirm()`.
- **Mobile chat pages**: Hide floating action buttons (like feedback FABs) that 
  overlap with chat input areas. Use `.chat-active` class on the app container 
  and hide the FAB via CSS `display: none`.
- **Disabled buttons**: Use `opacity: 0.45; cursor: not-allowed;` — never let
  disabled buttons still appear clickable. Apply `:hover:not(:disabled)` selectors
  so hover effects are suppressed on disabled state.
- **Mobile safe areas**: Always add `viewport-fit=cover` to the meta viewport tag
  and use `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` for fixed-bottom elements (FABs, chat inputs,
  toast containers) to prevent overlap with phone notches and home indicators.
- **Empty states must guide**: Every "no data" or "no company selected" state should
  include a brief sentence telling the user what to do next. Never leave an empty page
  with just a heading.
- **Loading skeletons over text**: Use CSS `skeleton-line` pulse animations instead of
  plain "Loading..." text. Skeletons feel faster and more polished.

## Step-by-Step: How to Redesign a UI

When asked to improve/redesign any UI, follow this exact process:

### Step 1: Audit the Current UI

Read the existing code and identify these specific problems (most UIs have all of them):

1. **Too much saturated color** — Large filled areas of blue, orange, red. Fix: reduce to 
   tiny accents only.
2. **Heavy borders and outlines** — Thick colored borders around cards/sections. Fix: remove 
   or make nearly invisible (1px, very light gray).
3. **Busy backgrounds** — Yellow, beige, or colored backgrounds on info sections. Fix: use 
   white or near-white only.
4. **Too many font weights/sizes** — Bold everywhere loses hierarchy. Fix: use weight 400 
   for most text, 500 for emphasis, 600 only for titles.
5. **Cramped spacing** — Elements too close together. Fix: add generous padding and gaps.
6. **Too many visual layers** — Nested boxes, borders inside borders. Fix: flatten. One 
   level of containment max.
7. **Outdated patterns** — Heavy shadows, gradient buttons, colored badges. Fix: replace 
   with flat, subtle alternatives.

### Step 2: Apply the Color System

Almost monochrome with ONE accent. This approach descends directly from Apple's 
iOS 7 design language (created under Ive's direction) — a precisely calibrated 
grayscale where the single accent color carries immense authority.

**Light theme (DEFAULT — always use this unless user asks for dark):**

```css
/* Backgrounds — luminosity hierarchy (Apple calls this "depth") */
--bg-page:          #FAFAFA;      /* Page — warm near-white */
--bg-card:          #FFFFFF;      /* Cards float above the page */
--bg-subtle:        #F5F5F4;      /* Grouped sections (like iOS Settings) */
--bg-hover:         #F0EFEE;      /* Hover feedback */
--bg-active:        #EAEAE8;      /* Active/pressed */

/* Text — 4 hierarchy levels (matches Apple's label/secondaryLabel/etc.) */
--text-primary:     #1C1C1C;      /* Headings, key data */
--text-body:        #3C3C3C;      /* Body text */
--text-secondary:   #787878;      /* Metadata, descriptions */
--text-tertiary:    #A0A0A0;      /* Placeholders, hints */

/* Accent — Apple system blue. ONE color, <5% of pixels. */
--accent:           #2563EB;      /* Deep confident blue — calmer than Apple’s neon #0A84FF */
--accent-hover:     #1D4ED8;      /* Hover state */
--accent-bg:        #EFF6FF;      /* 2% tint for selected states */

/* Semantic — based on Apple's iOS system colors */
--success:          #34C759;      /* iOS systemGreen */
--success-bg:       #F0FBF4;
--warning:          #FF9500;      /* iOS systemOrange */
--warning-bg:       #FFFBF0;
--error:            #FF3B30;      /* iOS systemRed */
--error-bg:         #FFF5F5;

/* Borders */
--border:           #E8E8E8;      /* Subtle structure */
--border-hover:     #D4D4D4;      /* More definition on hover */
--border-focus:     var(--accent); /* Focus rings */
```

**Rules (STRICTLY FOLLOW — these are the most common mistakes):**

1. **Accent color budget: max ~5% of screen pixels.** Accent (#2563EB) is ONLY for:
   - ONE primary action button per screen (the final/submit button)
   - Links (text only)
   - Focus rings
   - Thin progress bar fill (3-4px tall)
   - Active tab indicator (thin 2px line or text color only)
   - **That's it. Everything else is grayscale.**

2. **NO colored category labels.** Labels like "EXERCISE", "WARMUP", "STATUS" etc:
   - Color: `#787878` (medium gray) — NEVER orange, red, blue, green
   - Style: `font-size: 11px; font-weight: 600; letter-spacing: 0.06em; text-transform: uppercase; color: #787878;`
   - No background. No colored text. Just small gray uppercase text.
   - This is how Linear, Notion, and Apple apps (iOS Settings, Finder) show 
   category labels.

3. **NO colored info/description blocks.** Text blocks showing instructions, descriptions,
   previous results, tips, etc.:
   - Background: `#FFFFFF` (same as card) or `#F5F5F4` (barely different from page)
   - NEVER use yellow, beige, cream, light blue, or any tinted background
   - If you need visual separation, use only a 1px `#E8E8E8` top border or extra spacing

4. **Background is almost all white.** 90%+ of the page: `#FAFAFA` or `#FFFFFF`.

5. **Borders: 1px #E8E8E8 only.** No colored borders. Many elements need NO border at all.

6. **ONE accent color per app.** Don't mix blue AND orange buttons. Pick ONE color for 
   all primary actions. Secondary actions are always gray/outlined.

### Step 3: Apply Typography — Precision Instrument

Typography is the backbone. The principle (from Apple's SF Pro design): **one 
typeface, varied weights, tight letter-spacing on large text, open letter-spacing 
on small text, optical sizes tuned for each scale.** Like the laser-etched 
markings on a precision instrument — functional, measured, exact.

For web apps, **Inter** is ideal — variable weight, optically designed, tabular 
figures for data, excellent at small sizes. It's the closest open-source 
equivalent to Apple's SF Pro.

#### Font Recommendation Matrix (All Free & Open Source)

Pick the font that matches the personality of the project. ALL fonts below are free
(Google Fonts or open-source). Never use a paid font without confirming the license.

**Sans-serif (body & UI) — pick ONE:**

| Font | Personality | Best for | Get it | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Inter** | Neutral, precise, workhorse | App UIs, dashboards, tools | [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) / [rsms.me/inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) | The default choice. Variable font, 2000+ glyphs, 147 languages. Used everywhere: GitHub, Figma, Linear |
| **Geist** | Minimal, developer-focused | Dev tools, SaaS, technical products | [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Geist) / [vercel.com/font](https://vercel.com/font) | Vercel's typeface. Swiss design influence. Includes Geist Mono for code |
| **DM Sans** | Geometric, friendly | Marketing pages, creative products | [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans) | Low contrast, optically corrected. Pairs well with DM Serif Display |
| **Plus Jakarta Sans** | Warm, rounded, approachable | Consumer apps, fintech, health | [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Plus+Jakarta+Sans) | Indonesian design. Slightly playful but still professional |
| **Outfit** | Clean, geometric, modern | Landing pages, startups | [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) | Variable weight 100-900. Geometric but not cold |
| **Satoshi** | Premium, editorial | Brand-heavy products, agencies | [fontshare.com](https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/satoshi) | Free from Indian Type Foundry. Distinctive but readable |
| **Manrope** | Soft, modern, versatile | SaaS, productivity tools | [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Manrope) | Semi-rounded terminals. Variable font |
| **Albert Sans** | Neutral geometric | Corporate, enterprise apps | [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Albert+Sans) | Wide character set, very clean |
| **Space Grotesk** | Techy, slightly quirky | Developer tools, crypto, gaming | [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Grotesk) | Proportional counterpart to Space Mono |

**Serif (headings & editorial accents only) — optional:**

| Font | Personality | Best for | Get it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **DM Serif Display** | Elegant, high contrast | Hero headings over DM Sans body | [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Serif+Display) |
| **Fraunces** | Quirky, expressive, old-style | Playful brands, editorial | [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fraunces) |
| **Playfair Display** | Classic, refined | Luxury, fashion, editorial | [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display) |
| **Lora** | Warm, balanced, calligraphic | Long-form reading, blogs | [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora) |
| **Source Serif 4** | Clean, professional | Documentation, news | [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Serif+4) |

**Monospace (code blocks & technical data only):**

| Font | Get it | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Geist Mono** | [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Geist+Mono) | Best all-rounder. Pairs with Geist Sans |
| **JetBrains Mono** | [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/JetBrains+Mono) | Ligatures, tall x-height. The dev favorite |
| **Fira Code** | [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code) | Great ligatures, Mozilla origin |
| **IBM Plex Mono** | [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono) | Clean, corporate feel |

**System font stacks (zero-download, instant load):**
```css
/* Modern system stack — best performance, looks native on each OS */
--font-system: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif;

/* Mono system stack */
--font-mono: ui-monospace, 'Cascadia Code', 'Source Code Pro', Menlo, Consolas, monospace;
```
Use system fonts when performance is critical or you want zero layout shift.

#### Font Pairing Rules

Most apps need just ONE font family. But if you want more personality:

**Safe pairings (all free, tested together):**

| Heading font | Body font | Vibe |
|---|---|---|
| **DM Serif Display** | **DM Sans** | Elegant product page |
| **Playfair Display** | **Inter** | Editorial, luxury feel |
| **Fraunces** | **Plus Jakarta Sans** | Playful, distinctive brand |
| **Source Serif 4** | **Inter** | Professional documentation |
| **Space Grotesk** (bold) | **Inter** | Techy, developer-focused |

**Pairing rules:**
- Never pair two sans-serifs (too similar, creates confusion)
- Never pair two serifs (too busy, fights for attention)
- Serif headings + sans-serif body is the classic reliable pairing
- Match x-height between heading and body fonts (they should feel balanced)
- Use the heading font ONLY for h1/h2 — h3 and below should use the body font
- When in doubt, use ONE font family with weight variation. It always works.

```css
/* Font */
--font-sans:        'Inter', system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif;

/* Sizes — small range, not dramatic jumps */
--text-xs:          0.75rem;     /* 12px — timestamps, badges */
--text-sm:          0.8125rem;   /* 13px — secondary text, metadata */
--text-base:        0.875rem;    /* 14px — body text (standard for modern apps) */
--text-md:          1rem;        /* 16px — emphasized body, nav items */
--text-lg:          1.125rem;    /* 18px — section titles */
--text-xl:          1.375rem;    /* 22px — page titles */
--text-2xl:         1.75rem;     /* 28px — hero/main title */

/* Weights */
--weight-normal:    400;         /* Body text, descriptions */
--weight-medium:    500;         /* Emphasis, labels, nav items */
--weight-semibold:  600;         /* Page titles, section headers ONLY */

/* Line height */
--leading-tight:    1.3;         /* Headings */
--leading-normal:   1.5;         /* Body text */
--leading-relaxed:  1.65;        /* Long-form reading */

/* Letter spacing */
--tracking-tight:   -0.01em;     /* Large headings — slightly tighter */
--tracking-normal:  0;           /* Body text */
--tracking-wide:    0.02em;      /* Uppercased labels — open up a bit */
```

**Rules (STRICTLY FOLLOW):**
- Base font size is `14px` for app UIs (not 16px — that's for articles/blogs). 
  Linear, Figma, Notion all use 13-14px body text.
- Headings: `font-weight: 600` max. **Never 700/800/bold.** Heaviness feels clumsy. 
  For page titles, `500` is usually sufficient.
- Body text: `font-weight: 400`. Clean, invisible as a vehicle for content.
- Large display numbers (28px+): Use `font-weight: 300` — **light, not ultralight**. 
  Like the physical aluminum needle on the Ferrari Luce instruments: refined but 
  readable. Weight 200 can feel fragile; 300 has authority while remaining elegant.
- Labels and uppercase text: `letter-spacing: 0.06em` — small caps need air.
- **Negative tracking on headings**: Large text (20px+) uses `letter-spacing: -0.02em` 
  to tighten visual rhythm and give headings gravitas.

### Step 3b: Apply Text Formatting & Capitalization

Typography isn't just fonts and sizes — it's also **how you format the words themselves**.
Capitalization, punctuation, and text structure are critical and most apps get them wrong.
These rules are synthesized from Apple HIG, Microsoft Writing Style Guide, Google Material
Design, Google Developer Style Guide, and Anthropic's design principles.

#### The 5 Capitalization Styles

| Style | Example | CSS |
|---|---|---|
| **Sentence case** | "Upload your file" | (no CSS needed — write it this way) |
| **Title Case** | "Upload Your File" | (no CSS needed — write it this way) |
| **UPPERCASE** | "UPLOAD" | `text-transform: uppercase;` |
| **lowercase** | "upload your file" | `text-transform: lowercase;` |
| **Capitalize Each** | "Upload Your File" | `text-transform: capitalize;` (unreliable — capitalize in code instead) |

#### The Modern Default: Sentence Case

**All three major companies (Apple, Microsoft, Google) now recommend sentence case as the
default** for nearly all UI text. Sentence case means: capitalize only the first word and
proper nouns, lowercase everything else.

Why sentence case wins:
- **Easier to read** — mixed case gives words recognizable shapes; all-caps looks like rectangles
- **Feels more natural** — reads like normal speech, less corporate/formal
- **Better for scanning** — proper nouns stand out when everything else is lowercase
- **Localization-friendly** — many languages don't have capital letters; sentence case translates better
- **Modern aesthetic** — Linear, Notion, Vercel, Stripe, Arc all use sentence case

#### Capitalization Rules by UI Element

Follow this table STRICTLY. This is the consensus across Apple, Microsoft, Google, and
modern SaaS apps:

| UI Element | Case Style | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Page titles** | Sentence case | "Account settings" | NOT "Account Settings" |
| **Section headings** | Sentence case | "Payment methods" | NOT "Payment Methods" |
| **Subheadings** | Sentence case | "Add a new card" | NOT "Add A New Card" |
| **Button labels** | Sentence case | "Save changes" | NOT "Save Changes" |
| **Navigation / tabs** | Sentence case | "My projects" | NOT "My Projects" |
| **Menu items** | Sentence case | "Export as PDF" | NOT "Export As PDF" |
| **Form field labels** | Sentence case | "Email address" | NOT "Email Address" |
| **Placeholder text** | Sentence case | "Enter your name" | NOT "Enter Your Name" |
| **Tooltip text** | Sentence case | "Copy to clipboard" | Short, no period |
| **Error messages** | Sentence case | "That password is too short" | NOT "Error: Invalid Input!" |
| **Success messages** | Sentence case | "Changes saved" | NOT "Changes Saved!" |
| **Dialog/modal titles** | Sentence case | "Delete this item?" | NOT "Delete This Item?" |
| **Toggle/switch labels** | Sentence case | "Show advanced options" | NOT "Show Advanced Options" |
| **Checkbox/radio labels** | Sentence case | "Remember me" | NOT "Remember Me" |
| **Empty state text** | Sentence case | "No results found" | Add guidance on next steps |
| **Category labels/tags** | UPPERCASE | "EXERCISE", "STATUS" | 11px, gray, letter-spacing: 0.06em |
| **Badge text** | UPPERCASE | "NEW", "PRO", "BETA" | Tiny, muted colors |
| **Breadcrumbs** | Sentence case | "Home > Settings > Profile" | Match the actual page title |
| **Footer links** | Sentence case | "Privacy policy" | NOT "Privacy Policy" |
| **Product/brand names** | As branded | "GitHub", "macOS", "iPhone" | Always match the official casing |
| **Acronyms/abbreviations** | UPPERCASE | "API", "URL", "PDF" | Never "Api" or "Url" |

#### Special Cases: When NOT to Use Sentence Case

**Title case** is acceptable only in these specific situations:
- Product and service names (e.g., "Visual Studio Code", "Google Cloud Platform")
- Legal/formal text (copyright notices, terms of service headings)
- Book, song, or movie titles in citations
- Marketing headlines where the brand intentionally uses title case
- People's titles before names (e.g., "Vice President of Engineering")

**UPPERCASE** is acceptable only for:
- Category labels / tags: `font-size: 11px; font-weight: 600; letter-spacing: 0.06em; text-transform: uppercase; color: #787878;`
- Very short badge text: "NEW", "PRO", "BETA" (max 1-2 words)
- Acronyms that are always uppercase: "API", "HTML", "URL"
- **NEVER for emphasis.** Use italic sparingly instead. (Microsoft Writing Style Guide)
- **NEVER for full sentences.** "THIS IS HARD TO READ" — always avoid.

**all lowercase** — avoid this entirely:
- Microsoft: "Don't use all lowercase as a design choice"
- Capital letters help readers recognize new sections and sentence starts
- Exception: brand identity that specifically requires it (rare)

#### Text Structure & Punctuation Rules

**Headings and titles:**
- No period at the end of headings or titles (all companies agree)
- Keep headings short — aim for 3-8 words

**Dashes — avoid em dashes (—):**
- Never use em dashes (—) in UI text. They look AI-generated and unnatural.
- Use a regular hyphen (-) or rephrase the sentence instead.
- For separating clauses, prefer a comma, semicolon, or two shorter sentences.
- Good: "Period 2026-02 is open - close it now" or "Period 2026-02 is still open. Close it to continue."
- Bad: "Period 2026-02 is still open — should be closed"
- Use action verbs for task headings: "Create a project" not "Project creation"
- Don't use articles in short headings: "Settings" not "The Settings"
- If a heading has a colon, capitalize the first word after it: "Step 1: Configure the server"

**Button labels:**
- Use clear action verbs: "Save", "Delete", "Upload file"
- 1-3 words ideal. Never a full sentence.
- No period, no exclamation mark
- Be specific: "Save changes" is better than "OK" or "Submit"
- Destructive actions: be explicit — "Delete account" not just "Delete"
- Don't start with "Click" or "Press" — the button IS the action

**Form labels:**
- Keep labels above or to the left of the field
- No colons after form labels (modern convention — Google, Apple)
- Placeholder text should be an example or short instruction, not a repeat of the label
- Don't rely solely on placeholder text — it disappears when typing

**Error messages:**
- Don't blame the user: "Password must be 8+ characters" NOT "You entered an invalid password"
- Be specific about what to fix: "Enter a valid email" NOT "Invalid input"
- No exclamation marks — they feel aggressive
- No "Oops!" or "Uh oh!" — they sound insincere (Apple HIG)
- Place errors close to the problem, not in a generic banner

**Notifications and toasts:**
- Start with what happened: "File uploaded" not "Your file has been successfully uploaded"
- Keep under 10 words when possible
- No trailing periods on single-sentence notifications

**Lists and descriptions:**
- Use parallel structure: all items start the same way (all verbs, or all nouns)
- Good: "Create projects", "Manage users", "View reports"
- Bad: "Create projects", "User management", "Viewing reports"

**Numbers and dates:**
- Spell out numbers 1-9, use digits for 10+ (except in tables or data-heavy UI)
- Use relative dates when recent: "2 hours ago", "Yesterday"
- Be consistent with date format throughout the app

#### Capitalization in Code and Technical UI

When showing code elements, variable names, or technical identifiers in the UI:
- Don't change the casing of code terms — show them as they appear in code
- Use code font (monospace) to distinguish technical terms from regular text
- `camelCase` and `snake_case` stay as-is — never "fix" their capitalization
- File extensions stay lowercase: ".pdf", ".json"
- API names stay as documented: "REST API", "GraphQL"

#### Cross-Company Consensus Summary

| Rule | Apple | Microsoft | Google |
|---|---|---|---|
| Default UI text | Sentence case (recommended) | Sentence case (required) | Sentence case (required) |
| Headings | Sentence or title case (choose one, be consistent) | Sentence case | Sentence case |
| Buttons | Match your chosen style consistently | Sentence case | Sentence case |
| All-caps for emphasis | Avoid | Don't use | Don't use |
| All-lowercase text | — | Don't use | — |
| Colons in headings | Capitalize after colon | Capitalize after colon | Capitalize after colon |
| Hyphenated words | Capitalize first element only | Capitalize if would be capped independently | Capitalize first element only |
| Product names | Always capitalize | Always capitalize | Always capitalize |
| Internal capitalization | Don't use unless brand name | Don't use unless brand name | Don't use |

**The takeaway: when in doubt, use sentence case. It's the modern standard.**

### Step 4: Apply Spacing — Millimetric Precision

Use a **strict 4px/8px grid**. Every dimension is a multiple of 4. This creates 
the unconscious sense of order that Ive describes as "millimetrically perfect 
tolerances" — the same standard applied to CNC-machined aluminum parts.

```css
--space-1:    4px;     /* Minimum gap — icon to label */
--space-2:    8px;     /* Tight gap — related items */
--space-3:    12px;    /* Default inline spacing */
--space-4:    16px;    /* Standard padding */
--space-5:    20px;    /* Card internal padding */
--space-6:    24px;    /* Between related sections */
--space-8:    32px;    /* Between distinct sections */
--space-10:   40px;    /* Major section breaks */
--space-12:   48px;    /* Page-level separation */
--space-16:   64px;    /* Hero/key metric breathing room */
```

**Whitespace principle**: If a layout feels "done," add 20% more breathing room. 
Empty space IS the design — it creates focus, calm, and hierarchy.

**Where to use what:**
- Padding inside buttons: `8px 16px` (small) or `10px 20px` (regular)
- Padding inside cards: `20px` to `24px`
- Gap between items in a list: `8px` to `12px`
- Gap between sections on a page: `32px` to `48px`
- Page side margins (mobile): `16px` to `20px`
- Page side margins (desktop): `24px` to `40px`

### Step 5: Apply Borders and Radius — The Ive Curve

Ive is famous for his border radii. The iPhone's corners use a **squircle** 
(superellipse) — not a standard CSS border-radius, but the concept applies: 
**one consistent radius, used everywhere, creating a unified visual language.**

```css
/* Radius — Ive would pick ONE value and use it religiously */
--radius-sm:      8px;      /* Buttons, inputs, small elements — slightly larger */
                             /* than typical 6px for that Ive-era softness */
--radius-md:      12px;     /* Cards, panels — the signature Apple corner */
--radius-lg:      16px;     /* Modals, large containers — generous, inviting */
--radius-full:    9999px;   /* Pills, avatars, toggle tracks */

/* Borders — barely there. Ive eliminated visible borders wherever possible. */
/* Use spacing/shadow instead. When you must use a border: */
--border-width:   1px;
--border-color:   #E8E8E8;
--border:         1px solid #E8E8E8;
```

**Ive rules for borders and radius:**
- Pick ONE consistent radius for the project and use it everywhere. Mixing 4px, 8px, 
  12px, 20px on the same page is visual anarchy.
- **Prefer no border.** Use slight background color differences or subtle shadow to 
  separate elements. Borders are structure lines — they should be invisible scaffolding.
- **NEVER** use colored borders (blue/orange around active cards). This is a relic. 
  Use a barely-there shadow lift or faint background tint instead.
- The radius should feel **continuous** — matching between nested elements. If a card 
  has 12px radius, its inner elements should have 8px (radius minus padding offset).

### Step 6: Apply Shadows — Depth Through Light

Ive's approach to depth evolved from heavy skeuomorphic shadows (pre-iOS 7) to 
**almost imperceptible luminosity shifts**. Shadows should feel like natural light 
falling on layered sheets of paper — present but subconscious.

```css
--shadow-xs:      0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.03);                       /* Barely there — buttons */
--shadow-sm:      0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.04), 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.02);  /* Cards at rest */
--shadow-md:      0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);                      /* Hover lift — cards */
--shadow-lg:      0 12px 32px rgba(0,0,0,0.08), 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.04); /* Modals, drawers */
```

**The Ive shadow principle**: If you can clearly see a shadow, it's too heavy. 
Shadows should create a **feeling** of elevation, not a visible dark edge. Cards 
at rest should use `shadow-sm` at most. Many elements need **no shadow at all** — 
use a 1px border or background contrast instead.

### Step 7: Fix Specific Components

#### Buttons
```css
/* Primary — only ONE per screen section */
.btn-primary {
  background: var(--accent);
  color: white;
  font-weight: 500;
  font-size: 14px;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: var(--radius-sm);
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: background 0.15s ease;
}
.btn-primary:hover { background: var(--accent-hover); }

/* Secondary — for all other actions */
.btn-secondary {
  background: transparent;
  color: var(--text-body);
  font-weight: 500;
  font-size: 14px;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: 1px solid var(--border);
  border-radius: var(--radius-sm);
}
.btn-secondary:hover { background: var(--bg-hover); }

/* Ghost / Tertiary — minimal presence */
.btn-ghost {
  background: transparent;
  color: var(--text-secondary);
  font-weight: 400;
  padding: 8px 12px;
  border: none;
}
.btn-ghost:hover { background: var(--bg-hover); color: var(--text-body); }
```

**What to fix on buttons (CRITICAL — most apps get this wrong):**

- **NEVER make buttons full-width** unless it's a mobile bottom action bar.
  Full-width colored buttons look dated (2018 Material Design). Modern buttons are compact:
  - Width: `auto` (sized to content + padding). NOT `width: 100%`.
  - Exception: a bottom sticky action bar on mobile can have a full-width button, but it 
    should be slim (40px tall, not 48-56px).
  - If the button MUST span a container (form submit), use `width: 100%` but with reduced
    height (38-40px), lighter font weight, and smaller font size (14px).
  - **Disabled buttons**: should feel nearly invisible. Use `opacity: 0.35` and keep the 
    same bg as enabled but muted. NEVER make a disabled button still visually dominant.
  
- **REDUCE button size.** Most buttons in modern apps are smaller than you think:
  - Height: 36-40px (not 48px or 56px)
  - Font: 14px, weight 500 (never 600, 700, or bold)
  - Padding: `8px 16px` (compact) or `10px 20px` (standard)
  - Border-radius: 6-8px (not 12px+ — that's too bubbly)
  - **Watch for CSS flex stretch**: if buttons are in a `display:flex` container with 
    `flex:1` on children, they'll stretch to fill. Use `flex: 0 0 auto` to keep buttons 
    compact. Place in a container with `justify-content: flex-end` to right-align.
  
- **Only ONE filled accent button per view.** The final/submit/primary CTA.
  All other buttons: outlined (secondary) or text-only (ghost).
  
- **Don't mix accent colors.** If the primary button is blue, the secondary/completion 
  button is also blue — not orange, not green. ONE color.

#### Sidebar Navigation
```css
/* Sidebar: shadow edge, not hard border */
.sidebar {
  background: var(--bg-card);
  border-right: none;
  box-shadow: 1px 0 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.04);      /* Surfaces separate through light */
}

/* Nav items: subtle but tactile */
.nav-item {
  color: var(--text-secondary);
  font-weight: 400;
  background: transparent;
  padding: 9px 12px;
  border-radius: var(--radius-sm);
  transition: background 0.15s ease, color 0.15s ease;
}
.nav-item:hover {
  background: var(--bg-hover);                /* Subtle feedback — "physical" */
  color: var(--text-primary);
}
.nav-item.active {
  background: var(--bg-subtle);               /* Quiet present state */
  color: var(--text-primary);
  font-weight: 500;
}

/* Section labels: etched markings */
.nav-section-label {
  font-size: 10px;
  font-weight: 500;
  color: var(--text-tertiary);
  text-transform: uppercase;
  letter-spacing: 0.08em;
}

/* Logo: confident, not shouting */
.logo {
  font-weight: 500;
  letter-spacing: -0.02em;
}
```

**Sidebar rules:**
- **No border-right**. Use shadow edge: `box-shadow: 1px 0 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.04)`.
- **Subtle hover background** — interactive elements need tactile feedback. 
  Ive's Ferrari toggle switches are physical because "the functionality is superior." 
  A nav hover with zero visual response feels broken, not minimal.
- **Active: subtle bg fill** — the user needs to know where they are.
- **Section labels at 10px** with 0.08em tracking. Like etched instrument markings.
- **Logo at weight 500** — medium. Confident and readable.

#### Cards and Containers
```css
.card {
  background: var(--bg-card);
  border: 1px solid var(--border);  /* OR shadow, not both */
  border-radius: var(--radius-md);
  padding: 20px;
}
```

**What to fix on cards:**
- REMOVE colored borders (blue, orange, etc.)
- REMOVE colored/tinted backgrounds (yellow, beige, light blue)
- Background is always white (#FFFFFF)
- Border is always gray (#E8E8E8) or no border (use shadow-sm instead)

#### Inputs and Forms
```css
.input {
  height: 38px;
  padding: 0 12px;
  font-size: 14px;
  color: var(--text-body);
  background: var(--bg-card);
  border: 1px solid var(--border);
  border-radius: var(--radius-sm);
  transition: border-color 0.15s ease;
}
.input:focus {
  border-color: var(--accent);
  outline: none;
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px var(--accent-bg);
}
```

#### Status Badges and Labels
```css
/* Muted pill badges — NOT bright colored blocks */
.badge {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 4px;
  font-size: 12px;
  font-weight: 500;
  padding: 2px 8px;
  border-radius: 9999px;
  background: var(--bg-subtle);
  color: var(--text-secondary);
}
.badge-success {
  background: var(--success-bg);
  color: #1A7F37;  /* Muted green text, NOT bright green */
}
```

**What to fix on badges/labels:**
- REMOVE bright colored background badges (red label on orange bg)
- Replace with tiny muted pills: faint bg + darker text of same hue
- Or even simpler: just colored text, no background at all
- Emoji in labels is fine for personality — but the surrounding style must be subtle

#### File Drop Zones / Upload Areas
```css
.drop-zone {
  border: 1.5px dashed #D4D4D4;    /* Gray dashed, NOT accent colored */
  border-radius: var(--radius-md);
  padding: 40px 16px;
  text-align: center;
  background: #FAFAFA;              /* Very subtle, almost same as page */
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: border-color 0.15s, background 0.15s;
}
.drop-zone:hover {
  border-color: #A0A0A0;           /* Darker gray, NOT accent blue */
  background: #F5F5F4;             /* Slightly more visible */
}
.drop-zone.active {                /* File being dragged over */
  border-color: var(--accent);     /* Only during active drag = accent */
  background: #F8FBFF;             /* Barely blue tint */
}
```

**Rules for drop zones:**
- Default border: gray dashed, NOT accent-colored
- Hover: darken border to medium gray, do NOT turn blue
- Only during active drag-over: accent blue border is acceptable
- Background: `#FAFAFA` default, never bright blue/accent tint
- When file is loaded/filled: show solid border, gray, with the preview inside

#### Footer
```css
footer {
  text-align: center;
  padding: 24px 0 16px;
  border-top: 1px solid #E8E8E8;   /* Subtle separator */
  margin-top: 24px;
}
footer p {
  font-size: 12px;
  color: #A0A0A0;                  /* Light gray — very quiet */
  font-weight: 400;
}
```

#### Progress Indicators
```css
.progress-bar {
  height: 4px;               /* THIN — not 8px or 12px */
  background: var(--bg-subtle);
  border-radius: 9999px;
  overflow: hidden;
}
.progress-bar-fill {
  height: 100%;
  background: var(--accent);
  border-radius: 9999px;
  transition: width 0.3s ease;
}
```

**Progress bars should be THIN (3-4px). Not thick chunky bars.**

#### Selection / Toggle Buttons (like difficulty selectors)
```css
/* Chip-style selection (e.g., Easy / Normal / Hard) */
.chip {
  padding: 8px 16px;
  font-size: 14px;
  font-weight: 400;
  color: var(--text-secondary);
  background: transparent;
  border: 1px solid var(--border);
  border-radius: var(--radius-sm);
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: all 0.15s ease;
}
.chip:hover { background: var(--bg-hover); color: var(--text-body); }
.chip-selected {
  background: var(--accent-bg);   /* Very faint blue — NOT solid blue */
  color: var(--accent);           /* Blue text */
  border-color: var(--accent);    /* Blue border — thin */
  font-weight: 500;
}
```

### Step 8: Fix Layout and Spacing Issues

**Typical problems and fixes:**
- Content touching edges → add `padding: 16px 20px` on mobile containers
- Sections cramped together → add `margin-bottom: 32px` between sections
- List items with no breathing room → add `gap: 8px` or `padding: 12px 0` per item
- Inconsistent alignment → pick left-align for everything (centered only for hero/empty states)

### Step 9: Fix Large Numbers and Metrics — Precision Instruments

Think of the Ferrari Luce instrument cluster: physical aluminum needles, 
avionics-inspired dials, Samsung OLED displays. The key numbers are **present and 
authoritative** — not fragile. A precision instrument reads clearly.

```css
.metric-value {
  font-size: 32px;         /* Generous — let the number breathe */
  font-weight: 300;        /* LIGHT — has presence like a physical dial needle */
  color: var(--text-primary);  /* Near-black, never accent */
  line-height: 1;
  letter-spacing: -0.03em; /* Tight tracking at large size */
  font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums; /* Aligned columns */
}
.metric-label {
  font-size: 11px;
  font-weight: 500;
  color: var(--text-tertiary);  /* Small uppercase scaffolding — like etched markings */
  text-transform: uppercase;
  letter-spacing: 0.06em;
  margin-top: 6px;
}
```

**Rules for metrics/numbers:**
- **Font-weight: 300 (light) for display numbers.** Not 200 (too fragile) and not 
  600 (too heavy). 300 has the authority of a physical instrument needle while 
  remaining refined. It reads at a glance without demanding attention.
- Color: `#1C1C1C` (near-black). NEVER use accent for display numbers.
- Size: 28-36px. Not 48px+ (that's a billboard, not an instrument).
- The label underneath is tiny, uppercase, tertiary gray — like etched markings 
  on a precision instrument face.
- Use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` for aligned data columns.
- **Mobile**: Reduce size to 24-28px. Keep weight at 300 — it works at all sizes.

### Step 10: Fix Previous Data / Info Rows

Rows showing historical data, metadata, or contextual info ("Last time: 9/9 · Easy"):

```css
.info-row {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 8px;
  padding: 8px 12px;
  font-size: 13px;
  color: var(--text-secondary);  /* Gray text — not dark */
  background: transparent;        /* NO background tint */
  border-radius: 6px;
}
```

**Rules:**
- Background: `transparent` or `#F5F5F4` at most. NO tinted/colored backgrounds.
- Text: `--text-secondary` (#787878). Not primary dark text — this is supporting info.
- Icons/emoji: keep inline, small, doesn't need special styling.
- If you need visual grouping, use `border-top: 1px solid #E8E8E8` or whitespace. Not background color.

## Before/After Patterns

These show exactly what to change when you encounter common dated patterns:

### Full-width chunky button → Right-aligned compact button
Before: `width: 100%; background: #2563EB; color: white; font-weight: 700; padding: 16px 32px; font-size: 18px; border-radius: 12px;`
After: `width: auto; background: #2563EB; color: white; font-weight: 500; padding: 10px 20px; font-size: 14px; border-radius: 6px;` placed in a `display:flex; justify-content:flex-end` container.
If it MUST be full-width (mobile CTA): `height: 40px; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 500; border-radius: 8px;`

### Active stepper/tab indicator → Near-black, not accent
Before: `background: #2563EB;` for active step dot
After: `background: #1C1C1C;` — Active states use near-black, not accent blue. This is the Linear/Vercel pattern — accent is for CTAs only, not navigation state.

### Orange/colored category label → Gray uppercase
Before: `color: #E65100; font-weight: 700; font-size: 14px; text-transform: uppercase;`
After: `color: #787878; font-weight: 600; font-size: 11px; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: 0.06em;`

### Colored card border → Subtle card
Before: `border: 2px solid #2563EB; background: #F0F7FF; border-radius: 16px;`
After: `border: 1px solid #E8E8E8; background: #FFFFFF; border-radius: 10px;`

### Yellow/beige info box → Clean info section
Before: `background: #FFF8E1; border-left: 4px solid #FFB300; padding: 12px;`
After: `background: #F5F5F4; border-radius: 8px; padding: 16px;` (or just `background: transparent;`)

### Colored info row → Neutral info row  
Before: `background: #FFF3E0; padding: 8px 12px; border-radius: 6px;`
After: `background: transparent; padding: 8px 0; color: #787878; font-size: 13px;`

### Bold colored status label → Muted text label
Before: `background: #FF5722; color: white; padding: 4px 12px; font-weight: 700; font-size: 14px;`
After: `background: transparent; color: #787878; font-weight: 600; font-size: 11px; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: 0.06em;`

### Large accent-colored number → Clean number
Before: `font-size: 48px; font-weight: 900; color: #2563EB;`
After: `font-size: 28px; font-weight: 600; color: #1C1C1C; letter-spacing: -0.02em;`

### Mixed orange+blue buttons → Unified color
Before: Primary blue, completion green, cancel red — 3+ accent colors
After: ONE accent for all primary actions, everything else is gray outlined/ghost

## Dark Mode

Only implement if the user asks for it. When you do:

```css
[data-theme="dark"] {
  --bg-page:        #0A0A0A;
  --bg-card:        #141414;
  --bg-subtle:      #1C1C1C;
  --bg-hover:       #242424;

  --text-primary:   #ECECEC;
  --text-body:      #B8B8B8;
  --text-secondary: #787878;
  --text-tertiary:  #525252;

  --accent:         #4DA3FF;
  --accent-bg:      #0D2240;

  --border:         #2A2A2A;
  --border-hover:   #3A3A3A;
}
```

### Step 11: Apply Motion & Micro-interactions — Ive's Tactile Precision

Ive's approach to motion: **purposeful, brief, and physically plausible**. Every 
animation should feel like a real object responding to touch — not a decorative 
flourish. The iPhone's inertial scrolling, the bounce at the end of a list, the 
way cards settle after being released — all suggest real physics.

Apple HIG: "Don't add motion for the sake of adding motion." Every transition must 
serve comprehension (where did this come from? where did it go?).

```css
/* Transition tokens — precise, not lazy */
--duration-fast:    100ms;    /* Hover states, opacity shifts — instant feedback */
--duration-normal:  150ms;    /* Button states, border color — crisp response */
--duration-slow:    250ms;    /* Card expand/collapse — smooth but never sluggish */
--duration-enter:   200ms;    /* Elements appearing — slightly deliberate */
--duration-exit:    150ms;    /* Elements leaving — faster than enter (snappy) */

/* Easing — Apple uses spring-based physics. In CSS, approximate with: */
--ease-out:         cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);    /* Decelerate — the Ive default */
--ease-in:          cubic-bezier(0.5, 0, 1, 0.5);     /* Accelerate out */
--ease-in-out:      cubic-bezier(0.33, 0, 0.67, 1);   /* Position changes */
--ease-spring:      cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1); /* Bounce — use VERY sparingly */
```

**What gets transitions (ALWAYS add these):**
```css
/* Buttons, links, interactive elements */
transition: background var(--duration-normal) var(--ease-out),
            color var(--duration-normal) var(--ease-out),
            border-color var(--duration-normal) var(--ease-out),
            box-shadow var(--duration-normal) var(--ease-out);

/* Cards on hover */
transition: box-shadow var(--duration-slow) var(--ease-out),
            transform var(--duration-slow) var(--ease-out);

/* Don't transition these — they cause layout thrashing */
/* NEVER: transition: all; — always name specific properties */
```

**What does NOT get transitions:**
- `display`, `visibility` — use opacity instead
- `width`, `height` on complex layouts — causes jank. Use `transform: scale()` instead
- Anything on scroll — it's too laggy. Only use CSS scroll-snap or intersection observers

**Hover micro-interactions (Ive: barely perceptible, yet you feel them):**
```css
/* Card lift — the "sheet of paper rising toward the light" effect */
.card:hover {
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-md);
  transform: translateY(-1px);  /* Just 1px — if you can clearly see it move, it's too much */
}

/* Button press — instant tactile feedback, like a well-machined switch */
.btn:active {
  transform: scale(0.98);       /* Tiny shrink — physical, precise */
  transition-duration: 50ms;    /* Instant response — no lag */
}

/* Link underline reveal */
.link {
  text-decoration: none;
  background-image: linear-gradient(currentColor, currentColor);
  background-size: 0 1px;
  background-position: 0 100%;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  transition: background-size var(--duration-normal) var(--ease-out);
}
.link:hover { background-size: 100% 1px; }
```

**Rules (from Apple & Google):**
- Keep ALL UI transitions under 300ms. Animations over 500ms feel sluggish
- Enter transitions are ~30% slower than exits (Apple pattern)
- Never make users wait for an animation to complete before they can act
- Reduced motion: respect `prefers-reduced-motion` — replace animations with instant state changes
- No bounce/spring effects by default. Only use for celebratory moments (achievement, completion)
- No parallax scrolling. It causes motion sickness (Apple HIG)

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *, *::before, *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
  }
}
```

### Step 12: Apply Iconography

Icons should be **simple, consistent, and match the text weight**.

**Recommended free icon sets (pick ONE per project):**

| Icon Set | Style | Best for | Get it |

| **Tabler Icons** | Rounded, friendly strokes | Consumer apps | [tabler.io/icons](https://tabler.io/icons) |

**Icon rules:**
- Size: 16px for inline text, 20px for buttons, 24px for standalone/nav
- Stroke width should match your font weight: thin fonts = 1.5px stroke, medium = 2px
- Color: inherit from text color. Icons follow the same color as adjacent text
- Don't mix icon sets. Pick ONE and use it everywhere
- Don't use colored icons in lists/navs. Gray only (same as text)
- Accent color icons: only on the primary CTA or active nav item
- Always pair an icon with a visible label in navigation. Icon-only buttons need tooltips
- Don't use emoji as icons in professional UIs (emoji for content/personality is fine)

### Step 13: Handle Loading & Empty States

Modern apps NEVER show a blank white screen or a generic spinner.

**Skeleton loading (preferred over spinners):**
```css
.skeleton {
  background: linear-gradient(
    90deg,
    var(--bg-subtle) 25%,
    var(--bg-hover) 50%,
    var(--bg-subtle) 75%
  );
  background-size: 200% 100%;
  animation: skeleton-shimmer 1.5s ease-in-out infinite;
  border-radius: var(--radius-sm);
}

@keyframes skeleton-shimmer {
  0% { background-position: 200% 0; }
  100% { background-position: -200% 0; }
}

/* Skeleton shapes */
.skeleton-text {
  height: 14px;
  width: 80%;          /* Vary width for realism: 80%, 60%, 90% */
  margin-bottom: 8px;
}
.skeleton-heading {
  height: 20px;
  width: 50%;
  margin-bottom: 12px;
}
.skeleton-avatar {
  width: 40px;
  height: 40px;
  border-radius: 9999px;
}
.skeleton-card {
  height: 120px;
  width: 100%;
}
```

**When to use what:**
- **Skeleton screens**: for initial page load, list items loading, card grids
- **Inline spinner** (tiny, 16px): for button actions (save, submit) — show INSIDE the button
- **Progress bar**: for uploads, multi-step processes with known duration
- **NEVER**: full-page spinner overlay, spinning logo, "Loading..." text alone

**Button loading state:**
```css
.btn-loading {
  pointer-events: none;
  opacity: 0.7;
  position: relative;
}
.btn-loading::after {
  content: '';
  width: 14px;
  height: 14px;
  border: 2px solid transparent;
  border-top-color: currentColor;
  border-radius: 50%;
  animation: spin 0.6s linear infinite;
  margin-left: 8px;
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: middle;
}
@keyframes spin {
  to { transform: rotate(360deg); }
}
```

**Empty states (Apple HIG: "Provide clear next steps on any blank screens"):**
```css
.empty-state {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  padding: 48px 24px;
  text-align: center;
  min-height: 200px;
}
.empty-state-icon {
  font-size: 40px;               /* Icon or illustration, muted */
  color: var(--text-tertiary);
  margin-bottom: 16px;
}
.empty-state-title {
  font-size: 16px;
  font-weight: 500;
  color: var(--text-primary);
  margin-bottom: 4px;
}
.empty-state-description {
  font-size: 14px;
  color: var(--text-secondary);
  max-width: 320px;
  margin-bottom: 16px;
  line-height: 1.5;
}
```

**Empty state content formula:**
- Heading: acknowledge the emptiness briefly — "No projects yet"
- Description: tell them what to do — "Create your first project to get started"
- CTA button: the primary action — "Create project" (accent, compact)
- Optional: subtle illustration or icon (muted gray, not giant)
- NEVER: blame the user, use "Oops!", or leave the screen totally blank

### Step 14: Accessibility Essentials

Accessibility is not optional — it's how 15%+ of users navigate.
Apple, Microsoft, and Google all treat this as a core design requirement.

**Color contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum):**
- Normal text (under 18px): **4.5:1** contrast ratio minimum
- Large text (18px+ bold or 24px+ regular): **3:1** minimum
- UI components and graphical objects: **3:1** minimum
- Our color system already passes: `#3C3C3C` on `#FFFFFF` = 10.3:1 ✓
- `#787878` on `#FFFFFF` = 4.6:1 ✓ (barely passes — don't go lighter for text)
- `#A0A0A0` on `#FFFFFF` = 2.9:1 ✗ — only for decorative/placeholder text, never for essential info

**Focus indicators (keyboard navigation):**
```css
/* Visible focus ring — MUST be present on all interactive elements */
:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid var(--accent);
  outline-offset: 2px;
  border-radius: var(--radius-sm);
}

/* Remove ONLY the mouse-click focus ring, keep keyboard */
:focus:not(:focus-visible) {
  outline: none;
}
```

**Rules:**
- NEVER remove focus outlines globally (`*:focus { outline: none }` is an anti-pattern)
- Use `:focus-visible` so focus rings only show for keyboard users
- Focus rings must have 3:1 contrast against the background
- Tab order must follow visual order — don't rearrange with `tabindex` values > 0

**Touch targets (Apple HIG + Material Design):**
- Minimum touch target: **44x44px** (Apple) / **48x48px** (Google)
- Even if the visible element is smaller, the tap area must be at least 44px
- Spacing between touch targets: at least **8px** to prevent mis-taps

**Reduced motion:**
- Always include `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` (see Step 11)
- Replace animations with instant changes, not just removing them

**Text:**
- Don't convey meaning through color alone — add icons, text labels, or patterns
- Ensure all images have `alt` text (empty `alt=""` for decorative images)
- Use semantic HTML: `<button>` not `<div onclick>`, `<nav>` not `<div class="nav">`
- Form inputs must have associated `<label>` elements

- `references/desktop.md` — Multi-panel layouts, keyboard shortcuts
- `references/notifications.md` — Toasts, push, email, banners
- `references/components.md` — Detailed component specs

### Step 15: Mobile Responsiveness

Every app must work well on mobile. Use a **768px breakpoint** as the primary mobile cutoff.

**Layout patterns for mobile:**

```css
/* Primary breakpoint — tablet and phone */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  /* Sidebar → off-canvas drawer with overlay */
  .app { flex-direction: column; }
  .app-sidebar {
    position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; bottom: 0;
    width: 280px; z-index: 300;
    transform: translateX(-100%);
    transition: transform 0.25s cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
  }
  .app-sidebar.open { transform: translateX(0); box-shadow: 4px 0 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.12); }
  .sidebar-overlay {
    position: fixed; inset: 0; background: rgba(0,0,0,0.3); z-index: 250;
  }

  /* Add a sticky mobile header with hamburger */
  .mobile-header {
    display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 12px;
    padding: 12px 16px; background: var(--bg-card);
    border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border);
    position: sticky; top: 0; z-index: 50;
  }

  /* Main content: reduce padding */
  .app-main { padding: 16px; max-width: 100%; }

  /* Grids: stack or reduce columns */
  .dashboard-grid { grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 10px; }

  /* Data tables: horizontal scroll */
  .data-table { display: block; overflow-x: auto; white-space: nowrap; }

  /* Toolbars / period bars: stack vertically */
  .report-period-bar { flex-direction: column; align-items: stretch; }

  /* Forms: single column */
  .settings-row { flex-direction: column; }

  /* Chat: full-bleed */
  .chat-container { margin: -16px; border-radius: 0; height: calc(100vh - 120px); }

  /* Feedback popover: full width */
  .feedback-popover { left: 12px; right: 12px; width: auto; }
}

/* Small phones */
@media (max-width: 400px) {
  .dashboard-grid { grid-template-columns: 1fr; }
  .app-main { padding: 12px; }
}
```

**Mobile-specific rules:**

1. **Sidebar → hamburger drawer.** Never show a 240px sidebar on mobile. Use a slide-out 
   drawer with an overlay backdrop. Close it on navigation.
2. **Touch targets: 44px minimum.** All tappable elements (buttons, links, nav items) must 
   be at least 44×44px. (Apple HIG requirement.)
3. **Reduce padding.** Page padding: `16px` on mobile vs `24-32px` on desktop.
4. **Stack layouts.** Horizontal flex/grid layouts that use 2+ columns → stack to single 
   column or 2-column grid max on mobile.
5. **Horizontal scroll for tables.** Add `overflow-x: auto` on table wrappers. Don't 
   try to shrink table columns — they become unreadable.
6. **Full-bleed chat.** Chat interfaces should use negative margins to extend edge-to-edge 
   on mobile. Remove border-radius.
7. **Date inputs.** Use native `input[type="date"]` — they get native pickers on mobile.
8. **Text size.** Don't reduce body text below 14px on mobile. Headings can go slightly 
   smaller (18px vs 22px on desktop).
9. **Metric cards.** Reduce padding and shrink the number size, but keep cards in a 2-col 
   grid (not 4-col). Two numbers per row is comfortable to scan.
10. **Popovers and dropdowns.** Any fixed-width popover (e.g., feedback, dropdown) must use 
    `left: 12px; right: 12px; width: auto;` on mobile to avoid overflowing viewport.

**The hamburger button pattern:**
```tsx
<button className="hamburger-btn" onClick={() => setSidebarOpen(true)} aria-label="Open menu">
  <span /><span /><span />
</button>
```
```css
.hamburger-btn { display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 4px; padding: 8px; background: transparent; border: none; }
.hamburger-btn span { display: block; width: 20px; height: 2px; background: var(--text-primary); border-radius: 1px; }
```

**Always hide the mobile header on desktop:**
```css
.mobile-header { display: none; }
@media (max-width: 768px) { .mobile-header { display: flex; } }
```

## Final Checklist — The Ive Quality Gate

After applying changes, verify EVERY point. Ive would reject work that fails any of 
these. If ANY fails, go back and fix it. "Good enough" is not good enough.

1. **The gallery test**: Look at the interface. Does it feel like a well-lit art gallery — 
   mostly white/light gray with content as the exhibit? If colored blocks dominate → fix.
2. **Category label check**: Any colored category labels (orange, blue, green)? → Fix to 
   gray: `color: #787878; font-size: 11px; font-weight: 600; text-transform: uppercase; 
   letter-spacing: 0.06em;`
3. **Background tint check**: Any info sections using yellow, beige, cream, or tinted 
   backgrounds? → Change to `#FFFFFF` or `#F5F5F4` or `transparent`. White is the answer.
4. **Button discipline check**: Multiple accent colors? Full-width buttons? Font-weight > 500? 
   → ONE accent. Compact buttons. Weight 500 max.
5. **Display number check**: Are metrics using weight 600+? Colored (blue/orange)? → 
   Change to **weight 200** (ultralight), color #1C1C1C. This is the Ive signature.
6. **Border audit**: Colored borders? Borders thicker than 1px? → Fix to 1px #E8E8E8 or remove.
7. **Accent budget**: Count accent-colored elements. More than 2-3 per viewport? → Reduce. 
   Ive would likely say even 2 is too many.
8. **Breathing room check**: Sections have 24px+ gap? Cards have 24px+ padding? → Add space.
9. **Radius consistency**: Same radius everywhere? → Standardize to 8px (sm) or 12px (md).
10. **Weight audit**: Any body text using weight 600+? Any weight 700/800/900 anywhere? → 
    Reduce. Ive never uses bold. Maximum 500 for section titles, 300 for page titles.
11. **Capitalization check**: Consistent sentence case? → Fix per text rules.
12. **Ultralight display check**: Are key metric numbers using ultralight weight (200-300)? 
    If they're still at 600, they look heavy and corporate, not refined. Fix them.
13. **Sidebar chrome check**: Does the sidebar use a hard border-right line? → Replace with 
    barely-visible shadow: `box-shadow: 1px 0 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.04)`. Ive eliminates visible 
    borders wherever possible — use light to create edges, not lines.
14. **Page title weight check**: Page titles should use weight 500 (medium). Functional 
    and clear, like an instrument face label. Not 300 (too fragile for navigation).
15. **Navigation tactile check**: Do nav items have hover backgrounds? Active states? 
    Interactive elements need tactile feedback — "the functionality is superior" when the 
    user can feel where they are. Subtle bg-hover + bg-subtle active.
16. **Motion check**: Do all interactive elements (buttons, links, cards) have `transition` declarations? Are any transitions longer than 300ms? Is `prefers-reduced-motion` handled? → Add transitions, reduce durations, add reduced-motion media query.
17. **Icon consistency check**: Are all icons from the same set? Same stroke width? Same size in similar contexts? → Standardize to one icon set.
18. **Loading state check**: Does the app show skeleton loaders or inline spinners during data fetches? Or does it show a blank screen / full-page spinner? → Replace with skeletons. Buttons should show inline spinners during actions.
19. **Empty state check**: When there's no data (empty list, no results, first use), is there a helpful message with a CTA? Or just a blank area? → Add empty state with heading, description, and action button.
20. **Accessibility check**: Do all interactive elements have visible `:focus-visible` styles? Are touch targets at least 44px? Do text colors meet WCAG 4.5:1 contrast? → Fix per accessibility rules.
21. **Mobile check**: Does the layout work at 375px width? Is the sidebar a hamburger drawer? Do tables scroll horizontally? Do toolbars/controls stack vertically? Are touch targets 44px+? → Fix per mobile responsiveness rules.

If any check fails, go back and fix it before presenting the result.

## Mobile Responsiveness Rules

Modern UIs must work on mobile. These rules prevent the most common mobile breakage
patterns, learned from auditing real production apps.

### Breakpoints

Use these standard breakpoints consistently:

```css
/* Tablet / mobile */
@media (max-width: 768px) { ... }

/* Small phones */
@media (max-width: 400px) { ... }
```

### Critical Rules (STRICTLY FOLLOW)

1. **NEVER use inline fixed widths for layout containers.** Inline styles like
   `style={{ width: 340, flexShrink: 0 }}` or `style={{ display: "grid", gridTemplateColumns: "1fr 1fr 1fr" }}`
   cannot be overridden by media queries. Always use CSS classes with responsive rules.

2. **Every side-by-side desktop layout MUST stack on mobile.** If two panels sit
   next to each other on desktop (detail view, form + preview, etc.), they must
   stack vertically at ≤768px.

3. **Use `dvh` instead of `vh` for full-height containers.** On mobile browsers,
   `100vh` doesn't account for the URL bar or keyboard. Use `100dvh` (dynamic viewport
   height) for chat containers and other full-height layouts.

4. **Form grids must collapse.** A 3-column or 2-column form grid on desktop must
   become a single column on mobile. Use CSS grid classes with media query overrides.

5. **Button rows must wrap.** Multiple action buttons in a row should use `flex-wrap: wrap`
   so they don't overflow on narrow screens.

6. **Tables scroll horizontally.** Data tables should use `display: block; overflow-x: auto;
   -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;` on mobile. Don't try to stack table cells.

7. **Toolbars and filter bars must wrap or stack.** A row of search input + filter select +
   sort controls must either wrap or stack vertically on mobile.

8. **Touch targets: minimum 44px.** All tappable elements (buttons, links, form controls)
   must be at least 44px tall on mobile.

### Responsive CSS Utility Classes

Use these pre-built classes instead of inline layout styles:

```css
/* Two-panel layout: side-by-side desktop, stacked mobile */
.detail-layout     /* display: flex; gap: 20px → flex-direction: column on mobile */
.detail-sidebar    /* width: 340px → width: 100% on mobile */

/* Responsive grids */
.accounting-grid   /* 2-col grid → 1-col on mobile */
.form-grid-2       /* 2-col form grid → 1-col on mobile */
.form-grid-3       /* 3-col form grid → 1-col on mobile */

/* Header and toolbar patterns */
.page-header-bar   /* flex space-between → stacked on mobile */
.filter-bar        /* flex row → flex-wrap on mobile */
.form-inline-row   /* flex row → stacked on mobile */

/* Upload and button patterns */
.upload-layout     /* flex row → stacked on mobile */
.btn-row           /* flex row with wrap */
```

### Form Input Class

Use `.form-input` for standalone form inputs (not inside `.settings-field`):

```css
.form-input {
  height: 38px;
  padding: 0 12px;
  border: 1px solid var(--border);
  border-radius: var(--radius-sm);
  font-family: var(--font-sans);
  font-size: var(--text-sm);
}
```

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Fix |
|---|---|
| `style={{ width: 340 }}` on a detail sidebar | Use `.detail-sidebar` class |
| `style={{ gridTemplateColumns: "1fr 1fr 1fr" }}` inline | Use `.form-grid-3` class |
| `style={{ display: "flex", gap: 20 }}` for detail layout | Use `.detail-layout` class |
| `width: 380px` on login card | Use `max-width: 380px; width: calc(100% - 32px)` |
| `height: calc(100vh - 120px)` for chat | Use `100dvh` on mobile |
| Fixed pixel widths on form inputs (`width: 80`) | Use `max-width` with percentage or class override |

## Lessons Learned Across Iterations

Design is iterative. Here's what we learned across testing cycles:

**Round 1-2: Foundations**
- Light font-weight (300) for display numbers — like a gauge needle.
- Border-radius 8-12px. Card hover transitions add tactile quality.
- Sidebar: shadow edge instead of border. Section labels at 10px/0.08em.
- Page title weight 500 — confident for a tool UI.

**Round 3-4: Tactile feedback**
- Nav items NEED subtle hover/active backgrounds. Removing all backgrounds 
  made the sidebar feel lifeless. Visual feedback IS the functionality.
- Logo at weight 500. Medium weight is confident and readable.

**Round 5: Apple + Ive balance**
- Removing Apple references entirely made the design lose its digital polish. 
  Ive *created* Apple's design language — it's not an external influence, it's 
  the same mind. Apple HIG, Liquid Glass, iOS system colors, SF Symbols are all 
  valid references. Use the best of Apple's patterns without copying 1:1.
- Apple's iOS system colors are excellent references for semantic colors — we use 
  #2563EB (deeper blue, less neon than Apple's #0A84FF), #34C759, #FF9500, #FF3B30.
- Apple's grouped list pattern (iOS Settings) is the best reference for 
  sidebar navigation and settings pages.

**The compounding principle:** Each change seems minor. The aggregate effect 
transforms a "nice app" into something that feels crafted.

## Post-Deploy Verification

After deploying CSS/UI changes, ALWAYS test the app's core functionality:
1. Load the page — verify it renders correctly
2. Test the primary user flow (upload, submit, navigation) — ensure no API errors
3. Check the browser console for errors
4. If the app has an API backend, verify API calls return 200 (not 403/404/500)
